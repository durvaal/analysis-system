## About project

The idea is to analyze the binary and sequential search time, and the bubble and selection sort time, the chart exposes the relationship between the N sought by the search time for each approach.

There are the following functions when is Search Analysis:

- Reset: resets the analyzed data
- Add new data: search for a random N and record the analysis on the chart
- Remove data: removes the last analysis from the chart
- Order data: order chart data by N value ASC

There are the following functions when is Sort Analysis:

- Reset: resets the analyzed data
- Add new data: sort for a inputed list by user (N) and record the analysis on the chart
- Remove data: removes the last analysis from the chart
